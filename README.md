## 📚 Introduction

**Othello** (also known as Reversi) is a famous strategy game played by two players. The goal is to place your pieces on the board, flipping your opponent's pieces to your color. The game ends when no player can make a valid move, and the player with the most pieces on the board wins.
This project is a Python implementation of **Othello** using the **Pygame** library to create the graphical interface.
