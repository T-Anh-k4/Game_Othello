## ðŸ“š Introduction

**Othello** (also known as Reversi) is a famous strategy game played by two players. The goal is to place your pieces on the board, flipping your opponent's pieces to your color. The game ends when no player can make a valid move, and the player with the most pieces on the board wins.
This project is a Python implementation of **Othello** using the **Pygame** library to create the graphical interface.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Pygame (for the graphical interface and event handling)

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (or Download ZIP)

Using Git (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/T-Anh-k4/Game_Othello.git
cd Game_Othello
```

Or download the project as a ZIP file from [GitHub](https://github.com/T-Anh-k4/Game_Othello), then extract it.

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed.

Then open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

> If `pip` doesn't work, try `python -m pip install pygame`

---

### Step 3: Run the Game

From the project directory, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

> If your system uses Python 3 with a different command, try `python3 main.py`

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. The game starts with 4 pieces in the center of the board.
2. Players take turns placing their pieces (Black or White) on empty spaces.
3. If an opponentâ€™s piece is sandwiched between two of your pieces, it flips to your color.
4. The game ends when no player can make a valid move. The player with the most pieces on the board wins.
